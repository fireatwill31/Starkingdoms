Starkingdoms
============

The starkingdoms project.

-Potential changes/ideas.

1. Communication is a VITAL part of starkingdoms that most other games that copied SK have failed to accomodate, I think if you break it down, being able to rank is about 30% based on your ability to build your kingdom, and 50% on how well you communicate/suck up to others, and then 20% on pure luck, including hits, not getting hit, finding banks/suiciders, this is where multis help in, because it improves the 'luck' portion, aka. you manufacture your own luck. Anyways so communications is vital.
a) good forums. 
    i)sector forums
    ii)alliance forums
    iii)Universe forums( public forums)
    iv) UA forums?(would we want customized group forums? if they don't exist in game, I'm sure people would create them)
b) kingdom wall. Kind of like a facebook/messageboard on your kingdom, instead of a 'messaging' system, but with the option to hide/unhide messages, to both the sender/recipient. So basically both kingdoms in the conversation will have the message 'hidden' and when both kingdoms decide to reveal , they can both 'unhide' the message and it will show up.
c) dynamic chat, we want an 'alliance' chat, do we want to maintain the 3 seperate chats, or have them all actively show up in 1 window with tags like [AC]walls says: hi, [UC]walls says: Bye, or have your active chat open , you can swap between the 4(if we have UA chat) and have the option to see the other chats in there, and color code incoming messages from which chat
d) how much text formatting do we allow? B/I/U, emoji?

2. Cheating, how do we address the multi issue.
a) do we allow cheating? allow multiple IPs. 
  walls: I say we allow cheating, up to the point where if there are bots, we disable bot armies. but farming and etc. we will leave, maybe just resolve and look up IPS/login times and tell people if they are cheaters, or label them as (cheater) but no hard disables, or maybe reversing land, (prob better just to create a mod kingdom with 10k tanks and roll them)

3. Kingdom records.
  a

4. Multiple servers.
